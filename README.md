# World_Weather_Analysis


For this analysis I analyzed weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. By completing all of the the tasks I draw on my knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.

Have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, one will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## What will be Created:

This new assignment consists of three technical analyses. The following deliverables will be submitted:

### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
